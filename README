    Even though I failed to find my username or other relevant information about my ongoing game, I did find some interesting info.
    1. The WOW protocol stands for the communication between a client and a World Of Warcraft Authentication server, which is a game that owned by the company who owns the game I was playing: Overwatch.
    2. No.6170 and 6172 is a Hello Message between client and server as I was closing the game. Since it uses TCP, I assume it was disconnecting me from the server.
    3. During the game, a lot of packets were sent with UDP protocol, but I cannot find any valuable info from the packet as they are encrypted.
